# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-for-XNOR-Function-Learning

This project uses the NumPy library to implement and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the XNOR logic function. The neural network is trained using a simple backpropagation algorithm and tested for accuracy on all possible input combinations of the XNOR function.
