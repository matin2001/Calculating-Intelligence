# Fuzzy-C-Means-Clustering-Project

This project explores the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm using the skfuzzy library to compare its performance with the classic K-Means algorithm. Data from data1.csv is normalized and clustered with varying numbers of clusters (c from 2 to 10). The project uses the Fuzzy Partition Coefficient (FPC) to determine the optimal number of clusters and provides visualizations of the results.
