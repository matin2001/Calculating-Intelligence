# Genetic Algorithm for Polynomial Root Finding

This project implements a genetic algorithm to find the roots of various polynomials, including examples such as \(2x - 4 = 0\), \(x^2 - 8x + 4 = 0\), \(4x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 1 = 0\), and \(186x^3 - 7.22x^2 + 15.5x - 13.2 = 0\). The repository includes the source code, detailed documentation of the genetic programming process, and screenshots of the results.
