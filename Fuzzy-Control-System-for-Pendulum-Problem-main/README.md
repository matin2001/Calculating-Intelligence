# Fuzzy-Control-System-for-Pendulum-Problem

This project implements a fuzzy logic control system to stabilize a pendulum, aiming to align its center of gravity with a fixed point. The project utilizes the scikit-fuzzy library to define linguistic variables and rules that determine the torque applied to the pendulum. The system's performance is evaluated through a graphical simulation in a Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on achieving stabilization within 500 steps. The repository includes the source code and a detailed report on the system's design and performance.
