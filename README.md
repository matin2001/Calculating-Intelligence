# Calculating-Intelligence

This repository showcases a range of projects focused on calculating intelligence, including fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. These projects apply advanced computational techniques to solve complex problems such as clustering, control systems, polynomial root finding, and function approximation. Each project is accompanied by detailed documentation and examples, providing a solid foundation for understanding and implementing these intelligent systems.
