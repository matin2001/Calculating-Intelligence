# MLP-Neural-Network-for-Function-Approximation

This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to approximate the function \( y = x^2 \). The network is trained on data within the range \([-3, 3]\), and its output is compared to the actual values of \( y = x^2 \) to evaluate performance and accuracy.
